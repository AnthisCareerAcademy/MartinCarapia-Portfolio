I'm Martin Carapia, I've taken two AP courses with computer science.
AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A which I passed both tests. I've also attended Ivy Tech for Intro to Data Analytics (DBMS110) and passed.

I've attended TechFest and competed with Snider Highschool winning the programming section in 2022. 

I've been coding since 7th grade when I got my first laptop and got so bored of laggy roblox games that I thought I'd take it in my own hands to learn how to make my own game
I promised myself I wouldn't make it laggy (quickly found out it just doesn't work like that), so I started with python and discord.py to create a discord bot. discord.py was later discontinued
so I learned Javascript with youtube to use Discord.js although again I never got a really interesting project going. 

Now I've completed APCSA and have an understanding of Java and Python and am now learning C# for a project I'm working on. I cannot wait to continue my computer science education with the career acadamy and really
hope to get an internship so I may start in the workforce early in order to gain as much experience as I can get. 

My hobbies are playing guitar (in which I have my own band) and running/swimming! I hope to complete a any marathon or triatholon in the future.
